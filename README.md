# Saucelabs Demo Storefront Testing

This directory contains end-to-end testing for the saucelabs storefront demo at https://www.saucedemo.com/.

# Setup and Run

Use the requirements.txt file in this directory to build a virtual environment. 

Tests can be run by executing the pytest command in the project root directory. 

## Markers
Pytest markers (defined in pytest.ini) are used to categorize tests by feature and by test depth.

Use these markers to select a suite of tests to run.

`$pytest -m "login"`

"and/or/not" may be used to create more specific groupings of tests

`$pytest -m "login and smoke"`

## Reports

HTML reports can be generated by passing a path and filename to the html option:
`--html=reports/pytest_report.html`
Generate reports in the reports directory to keep them out of github.

Reports may be generated in a single file like so: 
`--self-contained-html`

Running a test with both of these options:
`pytest -m "login" --html=reports/pytest_report.html --self-contained-html`
